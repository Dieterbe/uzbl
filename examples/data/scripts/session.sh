# Very simple session manager for uzbl-browser.  When called with "endsession" as the
# argument, it'll backup $sessionfile, look for sockets in $socketdir and
# instruct each of them to store their current url in $sessionfile and
# terminate themselves.  Run with "launch" as the argument and an instance of
# uzbl-browser will be launched for each stored url.  "endinstance" is used internally
# and doesn't need to be called manually at any point.
# Add a line like 'bind quit = /path/to/session.sh endsession' to your config
